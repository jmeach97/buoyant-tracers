This repo contains the source code written and used during my PhD in modelling buoyant tracers in idealised velocity fields.

These include different models of velocity fields and buoyant particles, for example:
    
    Particle models:
        
        1. Passive floating tracer: these are particles which follow the horizontal surface currents passively, i.e. a two-dimensional Lagrangian advection problem.
        
        2. Slow manifold inertial floating tracer: these are particles which follow horizontal surface currents + a small deviation due to their finite size and density which differs from the background fluid
        3. NPC model: a very idealised model of the interactions between a floating species of plankton/neuston, and its reactions with passive nutrients/floating pollutants
    
    Velocity models:
        
        1. Delta correlated Gaussian Random Fields:
        
        2. Time correlated Gaussian Random Fields:
        
        3. Quasigeostrophic turbulent velocity field:
